title: "Introduction to Nextflow Pipeline Development"
---

This workshop is designed to provide participants with a fundamental understanding of workflow development using Nextflow. The goal of this workshop is to provide participants with the skills required to create a simple Nextflow pipeline from scratch, with a focus on reading input data and parallel job submission to the HPC. 


### Course Presenters

- Richard Lupat, Bioinformatics Core Facility
- Miriam Yeung, Cancer Genomics Translational Research Centre

### Course Helpers

- Sanduni Rajapaksa, Research Computing Facility
- Henrietta Holze, Dawson Lab

### Prerequisites

Attendance in the 'Introduction to Nextflow and Running nf-core Workflows' workshop, or an understanding of the Nextflow concepts outlined in the workshop materials: https://pmcc-bioinformaticscore.github.io/nextflow-intro-workshop/

### Learning Objectives:
By the end of this workshop, participants should be able to:

- Develop a basic Nextflow workflow consisting of processes that use multiple scripting languages
- Read data of different types into a Nextflow workflow
- Submit workflow processes with customised resources and container configurations to the cluster
- Gain an understanding of Groovy / Nextflow syntax
