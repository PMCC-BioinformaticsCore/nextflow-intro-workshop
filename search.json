    "text": "This workshop is designed to provide participants with a foundational understanding of Nextflow and nf-core pipelines, with a focus on running existing pipelines efficiently. Participants are expected to have prior experience with the command-line interface and working with cluster systems like Slurm. The primary goal of the workshop is to equip researchers with the skills needed to use nf-core pipelines for their research data.\nIt is not intended for those looking to develop new Nextflow workflows\n\nTrainers\n\nRichard Lupat, Bioinformatics Core Facility\nMiriam Yeung, Cancer Genomics Translational Research Centre\nSanduni Rajapaksa, Research Computing Facility\nHenrietta Holze, Dawson Lab\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\n\nExperience with command line interface and cluster/slurm\nFamiliarity with the basic concept of workflows\nAccess to Peter Mac Cluster\n\n\n\nLearning Objectives:\nBy the end of this workshop, participants should be able to:\n\nGain exposure to key concepts and terminology in Nextflow and nf-core pipelines.\nUnderstand the foundational knowledge required to navigate and customize the code base of nf-core pipelines.\nDevelop basic troubleshooting and customization skills necessary for responsibly applying nf-core pipelines to your own research data.\n\n\n\nSet up requirements\nPlease complete the Setup Instructions before the course.\nIf you have any trouble, please get in contact with us ASAP via Slack/Teams.\n\n\nWorkshop schedule\n\n\n\nLesson\nOverview\nTime\n\n\n\n\nSetup\nFollow these instructions to install VS Code and setup your workspace\nPrior to workshop\n\n\nSession kick off\nSession kick off: Discuss learning outcomes and finalising workspace setup\n09:30 - 09:40\n\n\nIntroduction to Nextflow\nIntroduction to Nextflow: Introduce nextflow‚Äôs core features and concepts; including CLI and how to run it on Peter Mac cluster\n09:40 - 10:20\n\n\nIntroduction to nf-core\nIntroduction to nf-core: Introduce nf-core features and concepts, structures, tools, and example nf-core pipelines\n10:20 - 11:00\n\n\nBreak\nBreak\n11:00 - 11:15\n\n\nCustomising & running nf-core pipelines\nCustomising & running nf-core pipelines: Discuss pipelines‚Äô required inputs, optional inputs, outputs, parameters file and configurations files\n11:15 - 11:45\n\n\nTroubleshooting nextflow run\nTroubleshooting nextflow run: Discuss Nextflow logging, caching, task execution directory, dependencies, and manual troubleshooting\n11:45 - 12:15\n\n\nBest practise and Q&A\nBest practise, tips & tricks for running nextflow pipelines at Peter Mac cluster\n12:15 - 12:45\n\n\n\n\n\nCredits and acknowledgement\nThis workshop is adapted from Customising Nf-Core Workshop materials from Sydney Informatics Hub"

    "text": "Option 1: Install and set up Visual Studio Code\nWe recommend Visual Studio Code as a source code editor because it is lightweight and has rich support for extensions and syntax highlighting available across various popular operating system.\nDownload Visual Studio Code on your computer and follow the instructions for your specific Operating System as required:\n\nmacOS\nWindows\nLinux\n\nOnce installed, open VS Code on your computer.\n\n\nInstall the Nextflow Extension\nThe Nextflow extension provides syntax highlighting and quick shortcuts for common code snippets.\nClick on the extensions button (four blocks) on the left side bar. Search for ‚ÄúNextflow‚Äù in the extensions search bar, then click on the blue ‚ÄúInstall‚Äù button.\n\n\n\nInstall the Remote-SSH Extension\nRemote-SSH allows us to use any remote machine with a SSH server as your development environment. This lets us work directly on the our cluster‚Äôs storage.\nClick on the extensions button (four blocks) on the left side bar. Search for ‚ÄúRemote - SSH‚Äù in the extensions search bar, then click on the blue ‚ÄúInstall‚Äù button.\n\n\n\nLogin via Visual Studio Code\nConnect to your instance with VS code by adding the host details to your .ssh config file (if you have not done this previously)\n\nIn a new VS code window, type Ctrl+Shift+P if you‚Äôre on a Windows machine or Cmd+Shift+P for MacOS to open the command palette\nSelect Remote-SSH: Open SSH configuration file and select your .ssh config file\nAdd a new entry with your details to login to cluster, and save your .ssh config file:\n\nHost pmac-cluster\n    HostName kvmpr-res-lnode1.unix.petermac.org.au\n    User &lt;your-cluster-user-name&gt;\n\nType Ctrl+Shift+P and select Remote-SSH: Connect to Host; and pmac-cluster (or whatever you name your host above)\nWhen prompted, select Linux as the platform of the remote host from the dropdown menu\nType in your password and hit enter\n\nHaving successfully logged in, you should see a small blue or green box in the bottom left corner of your screen:\n\nTo set up your VS Code window for the workshop:\n\nOpen a new folder in the file explorer panel on the left side of the screen by typing Ctrl + K, Ctrl + O if you‚Äôre running Windows or Cmd+K+ Cmd + O for MacOS\nSelect /scratch/users/&lt;your-username&gt;/nfWorkshop to open our working directory. If you encountered an error that the directory does not exist, you would need to ssh in to the cluster and create that directory first before attempting this step.\nWhen prompted, select the box for Trust the authors of all files in the parent folder ‚Äòhome‚Äô then click Yes, I trust the authors\nYou can dismiss the warning message saying our cluster‚Äôs git version is outdated\nTo open a terminal, type Ctrl+J if you‚Äôre on a Windows machine or Cmd+J on MacOS"
