title: "Introduction to Nextflow and running nf-core workflows"
---

This workshop is designed to provide participants with a foundational understanding of Nextflow and nf-core pipelines, with a focus on running existing pipelines efficiently. Participants are expected to have prior experience with the command-line interface and working with cluster systems like Slurm. The primary goal of the workshop is to equip researchers with the skills needed to use nf-core pipelines for their research data. 

*It is not intended for those looking to develop new Nextflow workflows*

### Course Presenters

- Richard Lupat, Bioinformatics Core Facility
- Miriam Yeung, Cancer Genomics Translational Research Centre

### Course Helpers

- Sanduni Rajapaksa, Research Computing Facility
- Song Li, Bioinformatics Core Facility
- Henrietta Holze, Dawson Lab

### Prerequisites

- Experience with command line interface and cluster/slurm
- Familiarity with the basic concept of workflows
- Access to Peter Mac Cluster

### Learning Objectives:
By the end of this workshop, participants should be able to:

- Gain exposure to key concepts and terminology in Nextflow and nf-core pipelines.
- Understand the foundational knowledge required to navigate and customize the code base of nf-core pipelines.
- Develop basic troubleshooting and customization skills necessary for responsibly applying nf-core pipelines to your own research data.
